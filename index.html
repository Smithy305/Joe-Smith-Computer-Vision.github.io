    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing my PhD at Newcastle University, where I research Image Formation and Digitisation Bias in Fine-Grained Classification Tasks. My work is conducted in collaboration with Procter & Gamble, focusing on how image capture and processing methods impact the performance of machine learning models in recognizing subtle differences between similar classes.</p>
        <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, computer vision, and the challenges posed by real-world data. I am passionate about exploring innovative solutions to improve the accuracy and robustness of fine-grained image classification systems.</p>
        <p>Outside of my academic work, I enjoy watching and following basketball, with a particular interest in the analytics side of the sport. I also find relaxation in listening to indie music, which helps me stay creative and inspired.</p>
